# WOA7015 Group Project
The project is to predict normal and pneumonia by training AI models to recognize X-ray images of the lungs.This project focuses on learning how to use AI and exploring the differences between the ResNet model and the CNN model.

# Datasets resource

The data set is structured as follows:

  chest_xary-------------------------
  
      test----------------------------
          NORMAL----------------
          PNEUMONIA-----------
      train------------------
          NORMAL----------------
          PNEUMONIA-----------
      val-----------------------------
          NORMAL----------------
          PNEUMONIA-----------
  

Because the data set is too large to upload, please download the data set through this link and put it in accordance with this structure. The uploaded file contains only a few images for the test run after downloading, and cannot be used as formal training.

# Running
After the decompression is complete, ensure that all files are in the same directory, and run the

pip install -r requirements.txt 

on the command.
